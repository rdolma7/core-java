What is a Garbage collection:
Garbage collection is an automated process of deleting code that is no longer being used which frees up space and makes it easier for the developers to code. In Java applications, objects are created using heap memory and all objects have a class associated to it. During the garbage collection process, the garbage collector scans different parts of the heap looking for objects that are no longer in use. If an object no longer has references to it from anywhere else in the application, the garbage collector removes the object, freeing up memory in the heap. To ensure that garbage collectors work efficiently,  they use a mark and sweep algorithm. Unfortunately, we canâ€™t call garbage collector ourselves.
